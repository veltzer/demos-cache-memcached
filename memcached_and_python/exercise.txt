- install "memchached" on your linux box and check that it is working.
	There are many ways to install it.
	Install it in a way your prefer and defend your position about
	why you installed it the way you did.
	Write down why you chose to install memcached the way you did.
	(write arguments for this method and against this method).
	Check that you memcached works.
	Write does all the tools you used to check that your memcached server is running
	correctly.

- find out how to access memcached with python (you will probably need to install some
	python module?).
	Write two script (or one) that can insert data into the cache and pull
	data from the cache.

	* Think of the cache as a huge KEY/VALUE store.
	putting data is just like putting data in a dictionary in python (this means
	you will supply a key and value) and getting data is just like getting data
	from a python dictionary -> you will need to supply the key and you will get
	the value.
